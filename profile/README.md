## The Queenâ€™s Computing Society

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Weâ€™re the Queenâ€™s Computing Society (Queenâ€™s University Belfast, not the Canadian one). We help connect students together by running events, workshops and socials! 

These repos contain the tools, tech and tricks that make what we do possible, all open-source for both the sake of transparency and to show our members how we do what we do! 

See an improvement we could make? Spotted an error waiting to happen? Make a PR and weâ€™ll take a look at it (at some point, we are students too!)
